In his early stage, this form of art was characterized by movements and trends that sought to change traditional conceptions and ideas. During this period, artists experimented in new ways to express their ideas. After the end of World War I, a new type of art began to emerge. This type of art was marked by an intense period of growth in which artists experimented and changed traditional art forms.\n",

There is a wide range of opinions about his contributions to the field, but most agree that he was a pioneer of the concept. In the 20th century, the definition of art has undergone a number of changes. The term “art” has become more precise and clearer as the discipline has evolved, but it has also become more complex and more complicated.\n",

      "The concept of art has changed throughout history. The first definition of art was created in 1889, when the artist Georges Diderot published his theory on the subject. The definition of art was further extended in the 1960s by Clement Greenberg, who argued that art could not be created by anyone without a certain degree of aesthetic value. But the definition of art is still subjective and not necessarily agreed on.\n",

In the 20th century, art was dominated by many different styles, including Dadaism, the Harlem Renaissance, and even the Cubists.
