If the TIME ELEMENT is already in a standard format, then no need to convert it.\\n        TIME ELEMENT can be either a temporal interval (across months, yoy, mom, qoq, wow, quarterly etc.) or a temporal expression (time points such as specific dates, relative expressions etc.).\\n        Calculate date range for each time points based on the following conditions:\\n        1. For relative time expressions, calculate the date range based on a reference date - By default the reference date is the end_date in date input: {\\'start_date\\': \\'01/01/2020\\', \\'end_date\\': \\'15/09/2023\\'}\\n        2. To calculate the date range for \"last X years\", strictly follow below conditions:\\n                For \"last 1 year\", consider exactly one year before the reference year and set start date as January 1 and end date as Decemebr 31 of that year.\\n                For \"last X years\", where X is greater than 1, consider starting year = (reference year - X+1) and set start date as January 1 of starting year and end date as the reference date.\\n        3. To calculate the date range for \"last X months\", strictly follow below conditions:\\n                Consider reference month as the month in reference date.\\n                For \"last 1 month\", consider exactly one month before the reference month and set start date as first day and end date as last day of that month.\\n                For \"last X months\", where X is greater than 1, consider starting month = (reference month - X+1) and set start date as first day of starting month and end date as the reference date. (Example: if reference date is 14/09/2022, then last 3 months = 01/07/2022 - 14/09/2022)\\n        4. To calculate the date range for \"last X quarters\", strictly follow below conditions:\\n                For \"last 1 quarter\", consider exactly one quarter before the reference quarter and set start date as first day and end date as last day of that quarter .\\n                For \"last X quarter\", where X is greater than 1, consider starting quarter = (reference quarter - X+1) and set start date as first day of starting quarter and end date as the reference date.\\n        5. To calculate the date range for \"last X weeks\", strictly follow the below conditions:\\n                Consider reference week as the week in reference week.\\n                For \"last 1 week\", set start date as Monday and end date as Sunday of the previous week of reference week. (Example: if reference date is 14/09/2022, then last week = 05/09/2022 - 11/09/2022)\\n                For \"last X weeks\", set start date as Monday of reference week and set start date as the Monday of that week and end date as reference date. \\n        6.
