      "    1. METRIC CONSTRAINT : METRIC can be MEASURE or DERIVED MEASURE. User is asking for a comparison limit to be applied on the METRIC. It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied on a METRIC and \"COMPARSION OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\n",
      "    2. ADJECTIVE and TONE : Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing etc.) applied on the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of adjective and it can be postive or negative.\n",
      "    3. EXCEPTION : Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in question if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\n",
      "    4. RANK : Rank applied on a DIMENSION if any like top 5, bottom 3 etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE\", the adjective like top, bottom etc. and \"RANK VALUE\", a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in question, make it as 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it as either top or bottom.\n",
      "    5. RATIO FILTERS : This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated. Example 1: Question: bike share of sales in area, (where ENTITY of 'bike' is 'Bikes'), RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes'}]. Example 2: Question: in area, share of bike and cycle basis sales, (where ENTITY of 'Bike' is 'Bikes' and 'cycle' is 'Cycle') RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes', 'cycle': 'Cycles'}]. If there are no matched FILTERS, then keep RATIO FILTERS = []\"\n",
      "    6. APPLIED MEASURES: This is applicable only for DERVIED MEASURE. Identify the MEASURE on which the DERIVED MEASURE needs to be calculated. \n",

Always consider the longest n-gram match, not the sub-string. If there are multiple matches for an n-gram with context, return all such ENTITY in response. If you are returning any match which is not exactly present with the \\'other names\\', make sure that it is a noun phrase and there is a high similarity between the match and the matched \"ENTITY\".\\n\\nStep 2: Applying other conditions\\nOnce the match is identified, the next step is to identify other conditions from the user question and apply them to the identified matches. Refer to the following statements to understand different types of conditions to be applied:\\n\\n1. METRIC CONSTRAINT: METRIC can be MEASURE or DERIVED MEASURE. The user is asking for a comparison limit to be applied to the METRIC. It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied to a METRIC, and \"COMPARISON OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\\n\\n2. ADJECTIVE and TONE: Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing, etc.) applied to the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of the adjective and can be positive or negative.\\n\\n3. EXCEPTION: Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in the question, if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\\n\\n4. RANK: Rank applied to a DIMENSION, if any, like top 5, bottom 3, etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE,\" the adjective like top, bottom, etc., and \"RANK VALUE,\" a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in the question, make it 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it either \"top\" or \"bottom.\"\\n\\n5. RATIO FILTERS: This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated.\\n\\n6. APPLIED MEASURES: This is applicable only for DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the MEASURE on which the DERIVED MEASURE needs to be calculated.\\n\\nStep 3: Applying time tagger rules (ONLY IF time elements are present in the question)\\nIdentify the TIME ELEMENTS in the input question and convert them to a standard format (if not already) by applying the general time tagging rules. If the TIME ELEMENT is already in a standard format, then no need to convert it. TIME ELEMENT can be either a temporal interval (across months, YoY, MoM, QoQ, WoW, quarterly, etc.) or a temporal expression (time points such as specific dates, relative expressions, etc.). Calculate date ranges for each time point based on specific conditions.\\n\\nStep 4: Creating the response JSON\\nStrictly return the response in the exact same JSON format as follows, filling in the information identified from the previous steps. The keys mentioned in upper case in the response are constant.\\n\\nExample 1 - User input: \"show me the 2 top segments basis sales\"\\n- Your response should be:\\n{\\n    \"DIMENSION\": {\\n        \"segments\": [\\n            {\\n                \"ENTITY\": \"Segment\",\\n                \"RANK\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \"RANK ADJECTIVE\": \"top\",\\n                        \"RANK VALUE\": \"2\"\\n                    }\\n                ]\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    },\\n    \"MEASURE\": {\\n        \"sales\": [\\n            {\\n                \"ENTITY\": \"Sales\"\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nProvide reasoning for the response.\\n\\n            <</SYS>>\\n            \\n Now return a response for this question:\\nshow me the 2 top segments basis sales\\n\\n            [/INST]\\n            ', '\\n\\nThe user question is \"show me the 2 top segments basis sales.\" To answer this question, we need to identify the n-grams match between the question and the context, apply other conditions, and then create a response in JSON format.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify n-grams match\\nThe longest n-gram match between the question and the context is \"segments basis sales.\" We have identified the following n-grams match:\\n\\n* \"segments\" - matches with \"ENTITY\" in the context\\n* \"basis\" - matches with \"MEASURE\" in the context\\n* \"sales\" - matches with \"ENTITY\" in the context\\n\\nStep 2: Apply other conditions\\nBased on the identified n-grams match, we need to apply the following conditions:\\n\\n1. METRIC CONSTRAINT: The user is asking for a comparison limit to be applied to the METRIC. The comparison value is \"2,\" and the comparison operator is \"top.\"\\n2. ADJECTIVE and TONE: The adjective \"top\" has a positive tone.\\n3. EXCEPTION: There is no excluded filter in the question.\\n4. RANK: The rank is applied to the \"sales\" ENTITY, and the rank value is \"2.\"\\n5. RATIO FILTERS: There is no ratio filter in the question.\\n6. APPLIED MEASURES: The applied measure is \"sales\" for the derived measure.\\n\\nStep 3: Apply time tagger rules (ONLY IF time elements are present in the question)\\nThe question does not contain any time elements, so we do not need to apply any time tagger rules.\\n\\nStep 4: Creating the response JSON\\nBased on the identified n-grams match, application of other conditions, and absence of time elements, the response in JSON format is:\\n\\n{\\n    \"DIMENSION\": {\\n        \"segments\": [\\n            {\\n                \"ENTITY\": \"Segment\",\\n                \"RANK\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \"RANK ADJECTIVE\": \"top\",\\n                        \"RANK VALUE\": \"2\"\\n                    }\\n                ]\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    },\\n    \"MEASURE\": {\\n        \"sales\": [\\n            {\\n                \"ENTITY\": \"Sales\"\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nReasoning for the response:\\nThe response is created based on the identified n-grams match between the question and the context. The conditions applied include the METRIC CONSTRAINT, ADJECTIVE and TONE, EXCEPTION, RANK, RATIO FILTERS, and APPLIED MEASURES. The response includes the identified ENTITY and RANK values, as well as the applied MEASURE. The absence of time elements in the question means that we do not need to apply any time tagger rules.']\n"

It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied on a METRIC and \"COMPARSION OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\n",
      "    2. ADJECTIVE and TONE : Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing etc.) applied on the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of adjective and it can be postive or negative.\n",
      "    3. EXCEPTION : Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in question if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\n",
      "    4. RANK : Rank applied on a DIMENSION if any like top 5, bottom 3 etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE\", the adjective like top, bottom etc. and \"RANK VALUE\", a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in question, make it as 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it as either top or bottom.\n",
      "    5. RATIO FILTERS : This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated. Example 1: Question: bike share of sales in area, (where ENTITY of 'bike' is 'Bikes'), RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes'}]. Example 2: Question: in area, share of bike and cycle basis sales, (where ENTITY of 'Bike' is 'Bikes' and 'cycle' is 'Cycle') RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes', 'cycle': 'Cycles'}]. If there are no matched FILTERS, then keep RATIO FILTERS = []\"\n",

      "Step 2: Applying other conditions\n",
      "Once the match is identified, next step is to identify other conditions from user question and apply it to the identified matches.\n",
      "Refer to the following statements to understand about different types of conditions to be applied:\n",
      "    1. METRIC CONSTRAINT : METRIC can be MEASURE or DERIVED MEASURE. User is asking for a comparison limit to be applied on the METRIC. It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied on a METRIC and \"COMPARSION OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\n",
      "    2. ADJECTIVE and TONE : Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing etc.) applied on the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of adjective and it can be postive or negative.\n",
      "    3. EXCEPTION : Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in question if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\n",
      "    4. RANK : Rank applied on a DIMENSION if any like top 5, bottom 3 etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE\", the adjective like top, bottom etc. and \"RANK VALUE\", a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in question, make it as 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it as either top or bottom.\n",
      "    5. RATIO FILTERS : This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated. Example 1: Question: bike share of sales in area, (where ENTITY of 'bike' is 'Bikes'), RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes'}]. Example 2: Question: in area, share of bike and cycle basis sales, (where ENTITY of 'Bike' is 'Bikes' and 'cycle' is 'Cycle') RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes', 'cycle': 'Cycles'}]. If there are no matched FILTERS, then keep RATIO FILTERS = []\"\n",
      "    6. APPLIED MEASURES: This is applicable only for DERVIED MEASURE. Identify the MEASURE on which the DERIVED MEASURE needs to be calculated. \n",
