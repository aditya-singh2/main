It has two parts: \"COMPARISON VALUE\" is the value applied on a METRIC and \"COMPARSION OPERATOR\" is the operator (in symbols) applied between METRIC and COMPARISON VALUE.\n",
    "\t\t2. ADJECTIVE and TONE : Identify the adjectives (like least, highest performing etc.) applied on the matched ENTITY. TONE is the intent of adjective and it can be postive or negative.\n",
    "\t\t3. EXCEPTION : Excluded FILTER of a DIMENSION asked in question if any. DIMENSION should be the parent of the FILTER. Add a key \"EXCLUDE\" for such excluded FILTERS and set the value as \"True\" in the response.\n",
    "\t\t4. RANK : Rank applied on a DIMENSION if any like top 5, bottom 3 etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE\", the adjective like top, bottom etc. and \"RANK VALUE\", a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in question, make it as 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it as either top or bottom.\n",
    "\t\t5. RATIO FILTERS : This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated. Example 1: Question: bike share of sales in area, (where ENTITY of 'bike' is 'Bikes'), RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes'}]. Example 2: Question: in area, share of bike and cycle basis sales, (where ENTITY of 'Bike' is 'Bikes' and 'cycle' is 'Cycle') RATIO FILTERS = [{'bike': 'Bikes', 'cycle': 'Cycles'}]. If there are no matched FILTERS, then keep RATIO FILTERS = []\"\n",
