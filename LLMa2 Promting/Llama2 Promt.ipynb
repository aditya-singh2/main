For instance, if the user asks for the \"top 5 segments by sales,\" you should recognize \"top\" as the adjective, \"5\" as the rank value, \"segments\" as the dimension, and \"sales\" as the measure.

    "Identify the TIME ELEMENTS in the input question and convert them to a standard format (if not already) by applying the general time tagging rules. If the TIME ELEMENT is already in a standard format, then no need to convert it.

If there are multiple matches for an n-gram with context, return all such ENTITY in response.

      "\n",
      "4. RANK: Rank applied to a DIMENSION, if any, like top 5, bottom 3, etc. It has two parts: \"RANK ADJECTIVE,\" the adjective like top, bottom, etc., and \"RANK VALUE,\" a number that comes along with the RANK ADJECTIVE, immediately before or after. If there is no explicit RANK VALUE in the question, make it 1. Based on the meaning of the RANK ADJECTIVE, make it either \"top\" or \"bottom.\"\n",

      "5. RATIO FILTERS: This is applicable only for ENTITY \"Ratio\" in DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the FILTER on which Ratio needs to be calculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. APPLIED MEASURES: This is applicable only for DERIVED MEASURE. Identify the MEASURE on which the DERIVED MEASURE needs to be calculated.\n",

If the TIME ELEMENT is already in a standard format, then no need to convert it. TIME ELEMENT can be either a temporal interval (across months, YoY, MoM, QoQ, WoW, quarterly, etc.) or a temporal expression (time points such as specific dates, relative expressions, etc.).
